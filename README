Asset Importers
===============
These small command line, Qt-based helpers automate the processes of getting external
catalogs and importing them locally.

Configure and install with:

cmake -DBODEGA_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/something /bodega/src

Server
======
This directory contians the content distribution server. It is based on node.js, postgresql and redis.

Node modules are installed using npm from within the server directory and the server can be started with
the main.sh file.

All commands that follow are done relative to the server directory.

## Database setup

* Start the redis daemon (e.g.: /etc/init.d/redis start)
* Start the postgresql daemon (e.g.: /etc/init.d/postgresql start)
* Create a postgresql user (e.g. bodega). It does not need to be a super user or be able to create
  databases.
* Run the setup.sh file in the sql directory as the postgres user. Note that it assuesm the name of the
  postgres user is bodega. If you use a different user name or database name, this script will need
  to be tweaked.

## Node setup and module Installation

   $ npm install

Move config.sample.json to config.json and update/edit it if necessary.

## Quick Start

   $ ./main.sh

You can also start it directly with:

   $ node app.js

## Updating

    $ npm update

Updates to sql schemas, if necesary, will be found in in sql/updates with file names ordered in a
numerically ascending sequence.

## Running Tests

   $ make test

## Checking the code

We use jshint to check for common js errors and style issues.
Use a simple.

   $ make check

The configuration is stored in the .jshintrc file and the files which should be skipped are stored in the .jshintignore .
