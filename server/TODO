* Jade templated HTML page in lib/db/confirm.js for account activation

* list of featured apps

* errors audit
- the language of the some the errors is quite primitive and should be
   audited

* ability to upload assets
- and edit them (at least changelog)

Later
=====
* stream uploads
- express.js uses connect which uses node-formidable which doesn't
   allow streaming files and always saves them to a temporary file,
   there's a few bugs about supporting streaming in the formidable bug
   tracker we need to stay on top of that or implement it ourselves
* ability to sort by various parameters
    * created date - changelog or tag?
    * name
    * number of downloads
* identify the language of an asset (e.g. book only in latin or german)
* searching in other languages (new search idx table)
* robust rankings
- we could use wilson score to measure them,
   http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html ,
   e.g.
js:
function measureScore(positive, total) {
   if (total === 0) {
      return 0;
   }
   //the z score refers to a confidence.
   // computed according to the P-value of integral of a normal
   // distribution over (-Infty, x]. with the formula
   // z = Statistics2.pnormaldist(1 - (1-confidence)/2)
   // Uses 1.96 for a confidence level of 0.95
   var z = 1.96;
   var phat = 1.0 * positive/total;
   return (phat + z*z/(2*total) - z * Math.sqrt(
     (phat*(1-phat)+z*z/(4*total))/total))/(1+z*z/total);
}
sql:
SELECT asset, ((positive + 1.9208) / (positive + negative) -
   1.96 * SQRT((positive * negative) / (positive + negative) + 0.9604) /
   (positive + negative)) / (1 + 3.8416 / (positive + negative))
   AS ci_lower_bound FROM rankings ORDER BY ci_lower_bound DESC;
- we could also replace positive with # of favorites and total with #
   of downloads, which would equal to 'best applications'
* forums or other ways of letting content creators communicate with
   users
